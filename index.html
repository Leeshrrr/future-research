            This design fiction explores the possibility of using surveillance technology to do psychoanalysis and predict & prevent abnormal behavior by constructing futuristic devices. At the same time, the definition of data rights and privacy limits are also
            criticized in this topic.

            The Third Eye is designed for teenagers, people with mental disorders illness, as well as violent and criminal offenders.
        </h2>
        <p>
            The Third Eye is a pair of electronic contact Lens, mainly applying retinal imaging and machine learning for analysis. When wearing it, its retina-like imaging technology and sensor system allow it to capture images from the human eye's sight. By machine
            learning and modeling, it is able to identify key features in images it catches, such as the surroundings around the wearer, the web page he is looking at, and the words in the diary that he is writing. Binding with the profile in social platforms
            helps with better analysis by analyzing posts and chats. After semantic analysis, the Third Eye can determine the wearer's current state of mind and predict his behavior. When inappropriate content and abnormal status are detected, a reminder
            message will be sent to the guardian and suggestions for solution will be provided.

            Monitoring of adolescent psychological problems and prevention of suicide
        </h2>
        <p>
            The adolescent suicide rate is on the rise every year. At present, many parents that are too busy ignore the guidance of children's values and their mental health. So children may develop psychological problems, such as depression, and sometimes lead
            to suicide. Parents could wear the Third Eye for their children with consent (this can also replace their original glasses). When abnormal mental activities and suicidal thoughts are detected, parents will be alerted and get advises on how
            to deal with them, such as an in-depth talk with their children or go to see a doctor.

            Mental illness and violence monitoring
        </h2>
        <p>
            People with mental illness and violent tendencies often behave in more unpredictable and dangerous ways. The Third Eye can build models by collecting characteristic behaviors before their abnormal actions and do deep learning, so as to predict their possible
            risky behaviors and alert their guardians.

            Monitoring of parole offenders and potential offenders released from prison

        <p>
            The Third Eyes takes advantages over electronic anklets. In addition to the positioning function of the electronic anklet, it can also monitor the environment and determine whether the offender is likely to commit another crime based on the his action.
            In addition, the invisibility of contact lenses makes it easier for ex-prisoners to integrate into society and avoid discrimination.

            Critic: What is privacy?
        </h2>
        <p>
            When it comes to data rights and privacy, there are still controversies on the Third Eyes. The behavior of monitoring has existed for a long time, but the collection and monitoring of data directly from the perspective of human eyes obviously breaks through
            the boundaries of the definition of privacy in traditional monitoring. While traditional monitoring is conducted from a fixed perspective, and to some extent with the acquiescence of the monitored people, the Third Eye clearly starts from
            the first perspective and completely intrudes into the wearer's private sphere. Although the collection of data is necessary for model training, are the datas at every moment valuable and necessary? Do we need to contribute all the data? What
            is the boundary of privacy? Who owns the data rights?
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            We have already had some of these problems right now, from “coockie” to personalized tracking, but The Third Eye is definitely more private and aggressive than they are.

            To try to solve these problems, we introduce the concept of federated learning. Federated learning is essentially a distributed machine learning technique, or machine learning framework. Its goal is to achieve joint modeling and improve the effectiveness
            of AI models on the basis of data privacy security and legal compliance. Instead of uploading the dataset to a central server, users can train the model locally with their own data and upload the encoded data and trained model to the central
            server. When it is applied to the Third Eye, the regulator can only obtain the data of the wearer, like the prediction of abnormal behavior and mental activities, but not the raw data captured by the Third Eye sensor.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            In addition, data consent is also required. It is a fundamental principle that data cannot be collected without the consent of the source. So even if parents want their children to wear the Third Eye, they need to get the child's consent. There is a need
            for conventions to ensure wearer’s right to know what is going on and what the data is using for. It is also a challenge for guardians to gain the understanding of wearers to agree to use the device.
